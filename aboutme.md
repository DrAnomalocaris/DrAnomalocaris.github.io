Hi there! I'm a passionate bioinformatics researcher with a knack for uncovering the secrets of our genes. My recent postdoctoral journey at [Newcastle University](http://www.retinalstemcellresearch.co.uk/) has been all about exploring how spliceosomic mutations play a role in Retinitis Pigmentosa, using cutting-edge tools like Alphafold. This project has been an exciting opportunity to build a database of pathogenic mutations, helping to flag significant changes in protein structures.

Before diving into this adventure, I spent time as a research fellow at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/biosciences/) and the [Newcastle University Centre for Life](https://www.life.org.uk/who-we-are/), delving into the complexities of spliceosome mutations and their effects on retinal diseases. My experience also includes a rewarding stint at the [Institute for Research Biomedicine](https://www.irbbarcelona.org/en) in Barcelona, where I focused on human cancer genomics and developed various software and databases to support large-scale genomic studies.

Beyond the lab, I'm an enthusiastic programmer and a proud parent of two wonderful daughters. I love reading and [writing ](https://www.amazon.com/Haustoria-Biological-Hard-Science-Fiction/dp/198328954X)and junmping head first into projects just for fun.
