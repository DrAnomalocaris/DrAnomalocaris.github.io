Extremely easy to use:
``` echo hello world | pylog testing ```
and to view the log, jusy run pylog without any arguments.

If run without any arguments `pylog`, then it will just output the logs of all concurrent pylogs being run by the user.


In hindsight I have used this tool way too much to not make it into a proper pip package.
