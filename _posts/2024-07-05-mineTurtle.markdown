# mine Turtle

Mine turtle is a character from ASDFmovie, my kids love it and recetly they released a [kickstarter for a boardgame](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bigpotato/mine-turtle-its-a-blast). As we are not willing to wait until they release the game, me and my kids quickly wrote a [playable mockup of the toy](https://dranomalocaris.github.io/mineTurtle/). 

The game is simple, a sort of dare game, where you dare a player to do a challenge, then press the turtle, if it does not explode then they have to do the challenge and succeed to earn a point, but if the turtle explodes, then the person who proposed the challenge has to do it to not loose points.

Despite the gameplay that is meant to be played, my kids just love spamming the turtle.
