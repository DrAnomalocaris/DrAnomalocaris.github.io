Cece is a *Caenorhabditis elegans* worm. What so special about here? have you ever seen a wormðŸª± weating a ðŸŽ€ribbon? 
Well, there is also the fact that this worm has its entire brain emulated in real time. Its neurons for smell activate when close to food, its touch receptors activate when touching food. 
This is a whole brain upload and simulation. You can see all her neurons as they are being triggered:

You can watch her go, or use her as a nice clock to hang on a wall:

And as a clock, it also shows events that happened on that day, jokes, and most importantly, nematode facts.

If you think closing the app is murder, dont feel so distaught. the state of her mind is backed up regularly, and will be reinstated when opened again. 

Feel free to look at Cece and ponder the ethical and philosophical implications of brain uploading and simulation. Or better yet, foster an appreciation for those wee cute nematodes.

This project is based from and original code taken from [heyseth](https://github.com/heyseth/worm-sim). With many thanks for their work.

It is not currently available in the app store, I am working on it. But there is a regularly updated [APK file](https://github.com/DrAnomalocaris/Ceceapp/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk) ready for install in any android device.
